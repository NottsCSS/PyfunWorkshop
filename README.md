## Aim of Pyfun

Pyfun is a event consist of a series of workshop that was planned by the Computer Science committee **to introduce programming as a tool** to participants.

Thus, instead of just teaching the syntax and concepts of the python programming language, it guides participants towards creating simple python programs that perform interesting tasks, and in the process of doing so, participants may not only **understand how programming can be applied in daily life scenarios**, creating interest and motivation for them to explore and learn more, but also **learn simple programming in python in a fun, memorable way**.
